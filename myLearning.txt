O. PROJECT DEVELOPING
The following steps were done:
1) Create project with support for scss
ng new angular-bootstrap-example --style scss --prefix abe
2) Install Bootstrap and import Bootstrap module to use grid layouts
npm install bootstrap --save
@import "styles-variables";
@import '~bootstrap/scss/bootstrap-reboot';
@import '~bootstrap/scss/bootstrap-grid';
3) Install Angular Material
npm i -S @angular/material @angular/cdk @angular/animations
4) Import Angular Material
- style.scss
@import "~@angular/material/prebuilt-themes/indigo-pink.css";
- app.module.ts
import { MatCardModule } from '@angular/material/card';
imports: [MatCardModule]
- template
<mat-card class="col-md-6">1</mat-card>
5) Reset Bootsrap's styling to suit Angular Material

I. RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN

source: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_intro.asp

Responsive web design makes your web page look good on all devices.
Responsive web design uses only HTML and CSS.
It is called responsive web design when you use CSS and HTML to resize, hide, shrink, enlarge, or move the content to make it look good on any screen.

1. Use <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> to support responsive website design.
2. Do not use absolute CSS widths for page elements. Instead, consider using relative width values, such as width: 100%.
3. Use CSS media queries to apply different styling for small and large screens.
4. Use css box-sizing: border-box instead of content-box for better, intuitive responsive web design, 
especially when the content must be displayed  on different divices (desctops, laptops, tablets, mobiles).
source: https://css-tricks.com/box-sizing/

Today, the current versions of all browsers use the original 
"width or height + padding + border = actual width or height" box model.
With box-sizing: border-box;, we can change the box model, where an element's specified width and height 
aren't affected by padding or borders.

With a border-box it is easy to use relative width values, such as width: 100%.

Uiversal box-sizing with inheritance (css code):

html {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
*, *:before, *:after {
  box-sizing: inherit;
}

5. Image size
When using css property - width: 100%, the element will scale down, but it will also scale up to be larger than it's orginal size.
To avoid scaling up, use the css property - max-width: 100%. It will scale down, but not above it's originale size.

II. INCLUDE BOOTSTRAP TO ANGULAR PROJECT

source: https://medium.com/@oyewusioyekunle/how-to-add-bootstrap-to-your-angular-project-angular-8-6379fd6a0f46

Bootstrap is the world’s most popular framework for building responsive, and mobile-first sites.

1. Adding Bootstrap to the Angular project.
There are three ways of adding Bootstrap to Angular project:
Method 1: Using Angular CLI (npm install).
Method 2: Using CDN (Copy and Paste method).
Method 3: Adding bootstrap CSS files to your project (Using CSS import).

Method 1: Using Angular CLI (npm install).
From the command line interface install bootstrap and references it in angular.json

npm install bootstrap --save

If you want to use bootstrap Javascript function, you need to install JQuery and popperjs with it. BootstrapJS depends on JQuery

npm install jquery --save

Add popper.js to use it's functionality

npm install popper.js --save

Reference the path in angular.json file. Make sure you reference it under build node.

"build": {
            ...,
            "styles": [

              "node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css",
              "src/styles.scss"
            ],
            "scripts": [
              "node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js",
              "node_modules/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"
            ]
          },

You can also import bootstrap css into main css file in src folder. in that way it is possible to use scss variables.
@import "styles-variables"; (Create file styles-variables.scss in the src folder.)
@import '~bootstrap/scss/bootstrap-reboot';
@import '~bootstrap/scss/bootstrap-grid';


Method 2: Using CDN (CDN Referenced method).
This is an old way of referencing bootstrap in our project.

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://.../bootstrap.min.css" integrity="..." crossorigin="anonymous">

Method 3: Adding bootstrap CSS files to your project.
You can direct add bootstrap folders to your asset directory in your angular project and reference the folder directly into your style.css or style.scss using

@import url("bootstrap.min.css");

III. BOOTSTRAP VS NG-BOOTSTRAP/ANGULAR MATERIAL STYLES

BOOTSTRAP
To use bootstrap styles both jQuery and popper should be installed, as Bootstrap styles uses both libraries.
Angular manipulates DOM. jQuery does it too.
Bootstrap uses jQuery for a lot of its functionality and animations, but we can't say for sure that it would cause problems.
However, there are Angular's libraries that may be used instead of the Bootstrap: Angular Material. The other option is to use ng-bootstrap. 

ANGULAR MATERIAL
source:
https://material.angular.io/

https://medium.com/letsboot/quick-start-with-angular-material-and-flex-layout-1b065aa1476c
instalation, photo gallery: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6gJLs3ZZII
Angular project with Bootstrap (for grid) and Angular Material: https://medium.com/@tomastrajan/how-to-build-responsive-layouts-with-bootstrap-4-and-angular-6-cfbb108d797b
https://medium.com/better-programming/angular-8-series-part-4-add-angular-material-6501e91041d8
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u679SQsfRVM

Angular Material is specially designed for Angular projects and easy to implement.
With mat elements, you can make a nice interface in a very short amount of time.
Flex-layout is a package made for Angular to use CSS flex-box features, you just add directives in html tags to render it flexible and responsive.


a). Install Angular Material
npm i -S @angular/material @angular/cdk @angular/animations

or Angular CLI command
ng add @angular/material
b) import some of the available modules in app.module.ts file, ie:
import { MatCardModule } from '@angular/material/card';

and add to imports array:
imports: [MatCardModule]
c) use the directive in html template
<mat-card class="col-md-6">1</mat-card>
d) import one of the pre-build Angular Material themes into style.scss file
@import "~@angular/material/prebuilt-themes/indigo-pink.css";

e) It is good to reset Bootstrap's reboot.scss styling if there are used with Angular Material.
Remove Bootstrap outlines that don’t play nicely with Angular Material links and buttons.

inport styles-reset.scss into styles.scss.
styles-reset.scss file contains:

* {
    &:active,
    :focus {
      outline: none !important;
    }
  }
  
  label {
    margin-bottom: 0;
  }

f) Bootstrap sets link color and uses underline text-decoration on the hovered links. To change it add the following code to the styles-variables.scss:

$link-hover-decoration: none;    // remove underline from button links

$link-color: #3f51b5;            // set link color based on the used material theme
$link-hover-color: currentColor;

g) Create own custom Angular Material theme

The easiest way to install and add Angular Material to the project is by running Angular Material schematic
ng add @angular/material

It will ask for choosing a prebuild theme, adding HammerJS and setting up browser animations.


NG-BOOTSTRAP


IV. BOOTSTRAP LAYOUT VS GRID LAYOUT / FLEX LAYOUT

source:
https://medium.com/@tomastrajan/how-to-build-responsive-layouts-with-bootstrap-4-and-angular-6-cfbb108d797b
https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/angular/layout/grid-usage/


BOOTSTRAP LAYOUT
Bootstrap’s grid system uses a series of containers, rows, and columns to layout and align content.
It’s built with flexbox and is fully responsive.

Using Bootstrap grid to create responsive layouts in Angular applications.
Only bootstrap-reboot and Bootstrap-grid modules are used.
a) Create Angular project with support for SCSS
ng new angular-bootstrap-example --style scss --prefix abe

We set the prefix for our components as a initial letter of the project, hence abe

b) Install Bootstrap using 
npm i -S bootstrap
or
npm install bootstrap --save
c) Add imports
There are two ways of adding imports, but the first way is better as it enables to override any Sass variable used by the Bootstrap styles definitions.
The Sass variables may be used in other css files.

c 1) You can add import to the main scss file located in src folder

@import "styles-variables"; (Import variable as the first import. Create file styles-variables.scss in the src folder.)
@import '~bootstrap/scss/bootstrap-reboot';
@import '~bootstrap/scss/bootstrap-grid';

c 2) You can add imports to the angular.json file

"build": {
          "options": {
            "...": "...",
            "styles": [
              "node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap-reboot.css",
              "node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap-grid.css",
              "src/styles.scss"
            ]
          }


GRID LAYOUT - it is a CSS display: grid. It is supported now by all modern browsers.
Developers do not need to use Bootstrap 4 to support grid layout. They can use the CSS display: grid to achive the same.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bam83Xv4VMA
https://www.techiediaries.com/css-grid-layout-tutorial/

FLEX LAYOUT - semi-official Angular libraries: https://github.com/angular/flex-layout

V. BOOTSTRAP REBOOT.CSS

source: https://scotch.io/tutorials/a-look-at-bootstrap-4s-new-reset-rebootcss

The most popular 'reset' stylesheet for reseting browser syles was normalize.css.
Normalize.css reset your browser styles and gave you some dead-simple, super pretty base styles.
Normlalize.css doesn't use border-box by default though, requiring that you add it somehow.

Bootstrap uses reboot.css stylesheet for reseting browser styles. It does the following:
- uses box-size: border-box; by default on all elements.
- uses "rems" for Sizing and Spacing
- uses native font family - Uses the font the user wants / looks best for them
- most elements do not have margin top (h1, ... h6, p, ul, ol, dl, pre)
- mobile fast click - By default Reboot.css uses touch-action: manipulation to speed up any delay that might exist for touch users

Here is sumarization of different units of measurement:
px: Good for consistency, bad for accessibility
em: Good for accessibility, just okay for maintainability / consistency
rem: Good for accessibility, really good for maintainability / consistency

px - 100 pixels is always going to be 100 pixels long regardless if it is shown on a 4k monitor or in a 1000 or 5000 pixel sized container.
This is good for consistency but bad for usability since it doesn't scale well to user-specifc preferences.
em - is relative to the parent element. It is cool, but it gets complicated if one element is relativ to other which is relativ to another.
rem - everything is always relative to the root (aka, the body tag or html tag)

VI ANGULAR SCHEMATICS 

source:
https://angular.io/guide/glossary#schematic

https://medium.com/@tomastrajan/total-guide-to-custom-angular-schematics-5c50cf90cdb4

A schematic is a template-based code generator that supports complex logic.
It is library that defines how to generate or transform a programming project by creating, modifying, refactoring, or moving files and code.
The Angular CLI uses schematics to generate and modify Angular projects and parts of projects.
- Angular provides a set of schematics for use with the CLI.
  The ng add command runs schematics as part of adding a library to your project.
  The ng generate command runs schematics to create apps, libraries, and Angular code constructs.
- Library developers can create schematics that enable the Angular CLI to add and update their published libraries,
  and to generate artifacts the library defines.

Angular Material comes packaged with Angular CLI schematics to make creating Material applications easier.
Schematics are included with both @angular/cdk and @angular/material.

The folowing command uses an install schematic:
ng add @angular/material // install Angular Material, the Component Dev Kit (CDK), and Angular Animations in your project.

The following command uses component schematic
ng generate @angular/material:nav <component-name> // generates navigation component

https://www.techiediaries.com/angular-material-navigation-toolbar-sidenav/

https://code-maze.com/angular-material-navigation/
navigation with lazy loading: https://angular.io/guide/router#lazy-loading-route-configuration

Angular Material comes with very small building blocks like sidenav and toolbar that combined together can make a responsive navigation menu

To create responsive navigation with Angular Material the following components of Angular Material are needed:
- Toolbar - it is a part of the top of the page, where we can place navigation items, 
- Sidenav - it is important in an mobile mode.

The Angular Material navigation schematic will create a new component that includes a toolbar with the app name
 and a responsive side nav based on Material breakpoints.

ng generate @angular/material:nav <component-name>

Hide a Sidenav on a big screens:
a) add the this ng-class to the mat-sidenav element :
[ngClass]="{'hidden': !(isHandset$ | async)}"

b) set the display property to the hidden class to none in navigation.component.css file
.hidden : { 
           display : none;
}

isHandset$ - This is a break point (less than 600px) provided by angular material layout.
There are more breakpoints like tablet , tabletPortrait, handsetPortrait.

Adding content to the Sidenav:
a) Add content element <ng-content></ng-content> to <mat-sidenav-content> like the following:

  <mat-sidenav-content>
    <!-- Add Content Here -->
    <ng-content></ng-content>

b) Add the app-navigation element to app.component.html.
write content inside it and it will show in the sidenav content.

  <app-navigation>
    <!-- Content -->
    <h1>Hello</h1>
  </app-navigation>

VII. FONT-AWESOME

Font-awesome is the one of the most popular place to get icon to use for web design.
You can add font-awesome icon to your angular project using npm, and reference the css in your angular.json file.

npm install font-awesome


VIII. LAZY LOADING

IX MIGRATING FROM CSS TO SCSS

source: https://medium.com/@ngubanethabo.ambrose/migrate-from-css-to-scss-stylesheets-for-existing-angular-application-d61f8061f5b7
a) 
Run: 
ng config defaults.styleExt=scss

or
ng config schematics.@schematics/angular:component.styleext scss

or change it manually in angular.js file
"schematics": {
      "@schematics/angular:component": {
      "styleext": "scss"
    }
}

b) Change the file extension in all name_style.css files to name_style.scss
c) Change the paths whenever the path was used to the correct one


X. CHANGE PREFIX 
source: https://medium.com/@kashifazmi94/change-prefix-of-component-in-angular-application-34c8d8a86dbf

Step 1. Open to src/tslint.js file
Change the prefix name in the ‘component-selector’ from 'app' to other prefix
Step 2. Change prefix in angular.json

To create new project with a different prefix use the following command
ng new project-name --prefix myprefix

XII. ABSOLUTE PATH IN ANGULAR PROJECT
Angular ultimately build the project. The folder structure is as follows:
'dist' - root folder that contains: index.html, assets folder, main.bundle.js ect.

The absolut path to the assets folder is: '~/assets/img'

XIV. Element vs HTMLElement
HTMLElement refers explicitly to an HTML element whereas Element may refer to an XML element.
HTMLElements inherit from Element which inherit from Node.
https://www.w3.org/TR/2003/REC-DOM-Level-2-HTML-20030109/html.html#ID-58190037

Type assertions is like a type cast in other languages. It is recommended to use as for type assertion.
Type assertion using <type> is forbidden.
Type assertion using 'as' is prefered.

HTMLCollectionOf<T extends Element> is an interface of TypeScript.
It is a generic form of HTMLCollection. HTMLCollection is return by i.e. getElementsByClassName()

XVI. LINTER
lint, or a linter, is a tool that analyzes source code to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs.
The term originates from a Unix utility that examined C language source code.

ESLint vs TSLint: https://medium.com/palantir/tslint-in-2019-1a144c2317a9

XVII. THIS SETTIMEOUT()
https://www.toptal.com/javascript/10-most-common-javascript-mistakes

The keyword 'this' depends on the context.

When you invoke setTimeout(), you are actually invoking window.setTimeout().
As a result, the anonymous function (if used) being passed to setTimeout() is being defined in the context of the window object, which has no myMethod() method.
A traditional, old-browser-compliant solution is to simply save your reference to this in a variable that can then be inherited by the closure;

var self = this;   // save reference to 'this', while it's still this!

You can also use arrow function that keeps the context: () => { this.myFunction(); } 
instead of anonymous function: var self = this; function () { self.myFunction(); }

XVIII. ANIMATION DISPLAY

XIX. ROUTING
source: https://angular.io/guide/router
https://dev.to/ajonpllc/angular-material-router-outlet-3292


AppRoutingModule - The best practice is to load and configure the router in a separate, top-level module that is dedicated to routing and imported by the root AppModule.
By convention, the module class name is AppRoutingModule and it belongs in the app-routing.module.ts in the src/app folder.

Step 1) <base href="/">
add <base href="/">  to the index.html as the first child in the <head> tag to tell the router how to compose navigation URLs.
If the app folder is the application root, set the href value exactly as above.

On a local development machine (development process) the base href is "/": localhost:4200/.
However, on production server machine the href must be set up to the subfolder the website is in (root folder): href="/website/"
So all the pages, images ect will be realtive to the root folder.

CLI when building project:
ng build -prod --base-href /website/

Step 2) Router imports
import { RouterModule, Routes } from '@angular/router';

Step 3) Configuration
A routed Angular application has one singleton instance of the Router service.
When the browser's URL changes, that router looks for a corresponding Route from which it can determine the component to display.

The appRoutes array of routes describes how to navigate. Pass it to the RouterModule.forRoot() method in the module imports to configure the router.

Each Route maps a URL path to a component. There are no leading slashes in the path.
The router parses and builds the final URL for you, allowing to use both relative and absolute paths when navigating between application views.

const appRoutes: Routes = [
  { path: 'crisis-center', component: CrisisListComponent },
  { path: 'hero/:id', component: HeroDetailComponent },
  { path: 'heroes', component: HeroListComponent, data: { title: 'Heroes List' } },
  // Set up default route to a valid page (ptherwise localhost:4200 doesn't match any of the concrete configured routes)
  { path: '', redirectTo: '/heroes', pathMatch: 'full' },
  // Set up wildcard route. Put it at the end, as the router selects the route with 'a first match wins' strategy.
  { path: '**', component: PageNotFoundComponent }
];

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    RouterModule.forRoot(appRoutes)
  ],

Step 4) Router outlet

<router-outlet></router-outlet>
<!-- Routed components go here -->

The RouterOutlet is a directive from the router library that is used like a component.
It acts as a placeholder that marks the spot in the template where the router should display the components for that outlet.

Angular Material Navigation: If using Angular Material add <router-outlet> between <mat-sidenav-content> directive.

Step 5) Router links

<a routerLink="/path" routerLinkActive="active">my page</a>

The RouterLinkActive directive toggles css classes for active RouterLink bindings based on the current RouterState.

Add more classes to the RouterLinkActive directive as a string of classes such as [routerLinkActive]="'active fluffy'" or bind it to a component property that returns such a string.
The Router will add those classes when this link is active (and remove when the link is inactive).
